  "Forex trading is the act of buying one currency while simultaneously selling another currency, with the aim of profiting from the changes in the values of these two currencies over time. Of course forex trading can also lead to losses, which makes it a risky venture and one that should be examined closely before committing any actual trading capital.",
  "One benefit of forex trading is the huge volumes traded in forex markets each day, which eliminates any liquidity issues, at least for the currencies of the largest economies. Another benefit to forex trading is that anyone can participate with just a small initial investment.",
  "There is a tradeoff however. The small capital requirements in trading forex are due to the use of leverage when trading forex. This means that an investor can control $10,000 worth of currencies with an investment of as little as $25. While this can generate profits more rapidly, it can also lead to losses more rapidly and if the traders account is small they may soon find themselves the victim of a margin call and the loss of all their trading capital.",
  "The knowledge and skill required to successfully trade forex makes it anything but simple. Those considering forex trading should be sure that they have sufficient capital and that they are able to withstand the risks presented by forex trading, which include the potential loss of all your trading capital.",

export const CFDTrading: string[] = [
  "CFD trading is the activity of trading contracts for difference with a broker. CFDs (Contract for difference) are derivative products in which you can trade on the difference between a certain asset`s set starting value and its closing value. By using a contract for difference, which is basically just a contract between a buyer and seller that specifies a certain purchase price and allows for profits or losses based on the change in the price of the underlying asset during a specified time frame, a trader can participate in a financial market with a smaller initial investment.",
  "Since their introduction in the early 1990s, CFDs have become increasingly popular as investors appreciate the lower capital requirements. They allow investors to participate in markets they may not have had access to previously because of large margin requirements or regulatory issues. CFD trading gives traders the ability to go long or short on an asset, , and in the U.K.,traders can avoid the stamp duty since CFDs are derivative products.",
  "When trading CFDs you predict your chosen asset`s movement in the market. As you do in traditional trading, you Buy when your prediction is a rise in value and Sell when your prediction is a fall in value. This does not mean you are buying or selling the asset because when investing in CFDs you are investing in your right to earn from the asset`s movement not the asset itself. However, it is important to remember that you can lose your investments should the asset price move in the opposite direction from your prediction.",

export const CFDStrategies: string[] = [
  " With so many different markets available to trade with CFDs you might be tempted to try them all. This often process to be a recipe for disaster. Instead put your focus on no more than three markets initially and you`ll be able to improve more quickly.",
  "If you focus on a small number of markets you will have time to research each of the markets in depth each day. You`ll be able to place small trades in at least one and perhaps all each day as well. And with each passing day and each new trade you`ll learn more about what makes that market tick.",

  "By having all of this decided in advance you can avoid putting your capital at greater risk than you`re willing to accept. You are also more likely to avoid mistakes that many traders make when they trade without a plan, most notably those related to greed and fear.",
